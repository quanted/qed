Earthworm Fugacity Modeling is a simple fugacity approach was employed to estimate pesticides concentrations in earthworms. Fugacity is most often regarded as the "escaping tendency" of a chemical from a particular phase. Fugacity has units of presure, generally pascals (Pa), and can be related to phase concentratons.

The T-REX model (USEPA 2008) is useful for assessing exposures of terrestrial animals to pesticide residues on foliar surfaces of crops and seeds. The model cannot be used to assess pesticide exposures to terrestrial animals resulting from consumption of earthworms contaminated with pesticide mass present in the soil of the application site. In order to explore the potential exposures of mammals to pesticides present in the soil and earthworms present on the treatment site, a simple fugacity approach was employed to estimate pesticides concentrations in earthworms.
