NAME
     util - Manipulating character strings, numbers, and dates

ABSTRACT
     Over 100 routines are contained in the UTIL library.
     Routines from this library are currently used by more than
     25 programs. The library contains a mix of basic utility
     routines for manipulating character strings, retrieving and
     calculating various items associated with dates and time,
     sorting arrays, copying arrays, writing text to the screen,
     and reading text from the screen. This code is generally
     well documented, both internally and in separate
     documentation.

     The UTIL library is included in the LIBANNE distribution.

HISTORY
     Version 4.0 2002/02/25 - The name of the lib library
        distribution changed to libanne.  See libanne
        documentation for details.

     Version 3.1 1996/12/11 - Corrected how function CNVTDG
        converted degree-minute-second latitudes and longitudes
        to decimal degrees.

     Version 3.0 1996/03/01 - Include file names changed to lower
        case.  Renamed routines that return current date and
        time, date, and time to SYDATM, SYDATE, and SYTIME,
        respectively (had been DATNOW, JULDAT, and GETIME).

     Version 2.1 1994/08/11 - Updates

     Version 2.0 1994/05/27 - General release

     Version 1.0 1992 - General release, ported to UNIX platform.

     NOTE: Version numbers and dates are for the entire LIBANNE
           set of libraries.  A new version does not necessarily
           indicate that all of the libraries have changed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     UTIL is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension:
     use of include files. UTIL contains three routines that call
     system date and (or) time routines.  Versions are provided
     for Data General, Sun, PC (Lahey), Silicon Graphics, DEC,
     and Prime.

DOCUMENTATION
     A subroutine reference guide is provided in the
     distribution.
