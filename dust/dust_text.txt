<p>This is a draft implementation of a spreadsheet-based model that calculates the dermal uptake of pesticides by birds and mammals from contact with soil, exposure to 
direct spray, and exposure to pesticides attached to foliar surfaces. These exposure estimates are then used to estimate risk quotients based on available and extrapolated
toxicity data.  The output of the model will be used in the problem formulation phase of ecological risk assessment to assess the potential significance of chemical exposure to the dermis of birds and mammals as a result of pesticide application. Exposure estimates are based on pesticide application rate, application method, and biology of the non-target organism. DUST evaluates dermal exposures via interception of spray, contact with foliar and soil residues. DUST output is used to establish a rationale in problem formulation to either dismiss dermal exposure concerns or support further consideration in data collection and analysis phases of the ecological risk assessment.
