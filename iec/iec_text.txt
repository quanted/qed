IECV1.1 (Individual Effect Chance Model Version 1.1) estimates potential effects at an individual level. Generally, available toxicity data provides an LC<sub>50</sub> or an EC<sub>50</sub>, (the concentration at which 50% of the test population exhibits the designated endpoint, usually mortality).  The Agency uses the probit dose response relationship as a tool for deriving the probability of effects on a single individual.  The individual effects probability associated with the acute RQ is based on the mean estimate of the probit dose response slope and an assumption that that probit model is appropriate for the data set.  In some cases, probit is not the appropriate model for the data, and EFED has low confidence in extrapolations from these types of data sets.  In addition to a single effects probability estimate based on the mean, upper, and lower estimates of the effects probability are also provided to account for variance in the slope, if available.  The upper and lower bounds of the effects probability are based on available information on the 95% confidence interval of the slope.
