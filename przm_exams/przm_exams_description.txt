<p>The Environmental fate and Effects Division (EFED) of the Office of
Pesticides Programs (OPP) currently uses linked Pesticide Root Zone Model
(PRZM) and Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS) models for a refined
(Tier II) estimation of pesticide concentrations in surface waters for
drinking water and aquatic exposure assessments. The PRZM is a one-
dimensional, dynamic, compartmental model that can be used to simulate
chemical movement in unsaturated soil systems within and immediately below
the plant root zone. EXAMS contains a set of process modules that link
fundamental chemical properties to the limnological parameters that control
the kinetics of fate and transport in aquatic systems. Multiple-year
pesticide concentrations in the water column are extracted from the
PRZM/EXAMS simulation as the annual daily peak, maximum annual 96-hour
average, maximum annual 21-day average, maximum annual 60-day average, and
annual average. The upper 10th percentile concentrations(except annual
average) are used to compare against ecotoxicological and human health levels
of concern (LOC). </p>
