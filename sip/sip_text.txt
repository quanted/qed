<p>The SIP model is designed to estimate chemical exposure from drinking water alone in birds and mammals.  Dietary, dermal and respiratory pathways are not considered in this model and cannot be ruled out as additional sources of exposure.  For purposes of risk assessment, it is assumed that 100% of daily water needs are achieved through drinking water and that these needs are equivalent to the daily water flux rate.  The upper bound of exposure is estimated through the use of an allometric equation in daily water intake rate determination (units in mg/kg ? bw).  The equation also considers chemical water solubility.  Acute toxicity values are adjusted using LD<sub>50</sub> values while chronic toxicity is adjusted through NOAEC studies in birds and NOAEL data in mammals.  To determine whether drinking water poses a chemical risk to the study animal, users examine ratios of upper bound exposure estimates relative to either adjusted LD<sub>50</sub>, NOAEC or NOAEL values.</p>
