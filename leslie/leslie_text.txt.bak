Leslie matrix (model) is a discrete, non-negative, age-structured model,
which describes the development, mortality, and reproduction of organisms over a period of time. 
As one of the most popular models in population ecology, it was invented by Patrick H. Leslie in 1945.

A typical Leslie model is written as:
</p>
<br>

<p>
which can be expanded into:
</p>
<br>
<img src = "/images/latex/leslie/leslie_des_2.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;">
<br>
<p>Thus a Leslie matrix contains:
</p>
<br>
<li>age-specific fertilities in the first row</li>
<li>age-specific survival probabilities in the subdiagonal</li>
<li>zeros elsewhere</li>
