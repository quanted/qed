Exponential model (a.k.a. Malthusian growth model) is associated with the name of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus">Thomas Robert Malthus</a> (1766-1834), 
who first realized that any species can potentially increase in numbers according to a geometric series.
In 'Essay on the Principles of Pupulation', Malthus argued that in the absence of any constraints, human population will grow in a multiplicative
manner until the depletion of food.

  <li>All organisms are identical (e.g., no age structure)</li>
  <li>Environment is constant in space and time (e.g., resources are unlimited)</li>
