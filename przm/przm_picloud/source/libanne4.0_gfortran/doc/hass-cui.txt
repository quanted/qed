NAME
     hass-cui - Character-Based User Interface Used by HASS

ABSTRACT
     A character-based user interface (CUI) has been used for
     various programs supported by the Hydrologic Analysis
     Software Support (HASS) Program to enhance and facilitate
     program use.  The interface provides for consistent user
     interaction across hydrologic applications.  The system was
     designed for ease of programming and for portability to
     mini-computers and PC's as well as UNIX workstations.

USER INTERFACE
     Program interaction takes place in a screen 80 characters
     wide by 24 characters high.  Figure 1 shows the basic screen
     layout.  Each screen consists of a list of available
     commands displayed at the bottom of the screen and one or
     more boxed-in areas that are referred to as panels. Commands
     are used to obtain additional information and to move
     between screens. There are three types of panels--data,
     assistance, and instruction. The data panel displayed at the
     top of the screen is always present. Data panels contain
     menus, forms, tables, and text to permit user interaction
     with the program. An assistance panel may be present
     depending on user or program assignments. When present, the
     assistance panel is displayed below the data panel (usually
     as the middle panel) and contains textual information, such
     as help messages, valid range of values, and details on
     program status. The instruction panel is displayed above the
     available commands when the user is expected to interact
     with the program. When present, the instruction panel
     contains information on what keystrokes are required to
     interact with the program.

     Each screen can be identified by a name and the path
     selected to reach the screen. The screen name appears in the
     upper left corner of the data panel, where the words "screen
     name" appear in figure 1. The first screen displayed by the
     program is named "Opening screen". All subsequent screens
     are named based on the menu option or program sequence that
     caused the current screen to be displayed. Screen names are
     followed by "(path)", a string of characters consisting of
     the first letter(s) of the menu options selected in order to
     arrive at the current screen. In some cases, descriptive
     text may follow the path to further help identify the
     screen. The path can aid in keeping track of the position of
     the current screen in the menu hierarchy. For example, "Open
     (FO)" indicates that the menu option Open was selected
     previously and that the path to this screen from the
     "Opening screen" consisted of two menu selections--File and
     Open.

      key (";") followed by the first letter (upper or lower
      case) of the command can be used to execute the commands.
      The F3 function key may not be available on some systems.

      Commands

      The screen commands and their associated keystrokes are
      described in table 1. A subset of the screen commands is
      available for any given screen. Most commands can be
      executed by pressing a single function key. (The
      designation for a function key is "F#" where # is the
      number of the function key.) All of the commands can be
      executed in "command mode". Command mode is toggled on and
      off by pressing the semicolon (;) key. In command mode, any
      command can be executed by pressing the first letter of the
      command name; for example, "o" or "O" for the Oops command.
      When commands are discussed in this report, the command
      name is spelled out with the function key or keystroke
      given in parentheses. For example, Accept (F2) is the most
      frequently used command.

      Use Help (F1) and Limits (F5) to obtain additional
      information about the current screen and use Status (F7) to
      obtain information on the state of the program. Cmhlp (;c)
      will display information on the available commands. Use
      Quiet (F8) to close the assistance panel. To move between
      screens, use Accept (F2), Prev (F4), Intrpt (F6), Dnpg
      (;d), Uppg (;u), or Top (F10). To reset the values in the
      data panel, use Oops (;o). Xpad (F9) is used to save typed
      information in a file called XPAD.DAT.

      Data Panel

      There are four types of data panels--menu, form, table, and
      text. Menus offer a choice of two or more options. Data
      values are entered or modified in one or more data fields
      of a form or table. General or specific information,
      program progress, messages, and results of analyses may be
      displayed in a text data panel. The data panel appears at
      the top of the screen, as shown in figure 1. There are 16
      rows in the data panel when the assistance panel is closed
      and 10 rows when the assistance panel is open.

      A single option is selected from a menu that consists of
      two or more options. There are two ways to select a menu
      option. Either press the first letter (not case sensitive)
      of the menu option; if more than one menu option begins
      with the same letter, press in sequence enough characters
      to uniquely identify the option; or use the arrow keys to
      move the cursor to the option and then execute Accept (F2).

      Forms may contain any number and combination of character,



                     Last change: 29 May 2001                   4






U.S. Geological Survey                                hass-cui(1)



      numeric, file name, or option fields. Character fields may
      be a variable entry, such as a descriptive text string
      (case sensitive), or they may require a specific entry,
      such as "yes" or "no" (not case sensitive). The text string
      "none" in a field indicates that the field is currently
      undefined.  Option fields are activated and deactivated by
      positioning the cursor in the option field and pressing any
      key, such as the space bar. Use arrow keys to move up,
      down, and laterally between fields. The Enter (Return) key
      is used to move forward through fields.  Use Accept (F2) to
      accept the entered and modified data and continue with the
      program.  Executing Oops (;o) sets all fields in the
      current screen to their initial values. Executing Prev (F4)
      will cause the data values entered on the current screen to
      be ignored and the previous screen to be redisplayed.

      Tables may contain any number and combination of character,
      numeric, and file name columns. As with forms, character
      fields may require a specific entry or a variable entry.
      Use arrow keys to move up, down, and laterally between
      fields. The Enter (Return) key is used to move forward
      across rows and to the next row. Some tables may contain
      more rows than can be displayed in the 10 or 16 rows of the
      data panel. In these cases, the table is divided into
      multiple screens. Use Accept (F2) to move forward through
      each of the screens for the table and to continue with the
      program after the last screen of the table. Executing Oops
      (;o) sets all fields in the current screen to their initial
      values.  Executing Prev (F4) will cause the data values
      entered on the current screen to be ignored and the
      previous screen to be redisplayed. Executing Intrpt (F6)
      will cause the data values entered on the current screen to
      be ignored and the remaining screens in the table to be
      skipped. Use Quiet (F8) to close the assistance panel and
      view the 16 lines of the data panel.

      A text data panel may contain a warning or error message, a
      tabular list of data, a progress message for an activity
      that may take more than a few seconds, or other general
      information. Execute Accept (F2) to continue to the next
      screen. In cases where the displayed text requires more
      lines than the number available in the data panel, the Prev
      (F4), Dnpg (;d), and Uppg (;u) commands may be available to
      move forward and backward (scroll) through the screens.
      Note that the up and down arrows also may be used to move
      through the screens. Intrpt (F6) may be available to permit
      skipping the remaining screens of text.

      Assistance Panel

      The assistance panel provides information to help the user
      enter data in the data panel or to allow note taking during

      a program session. The panel appears in the middle of the
      screen below the data panel. A name corresponding to the
      type of assistance being provided displays in the upper
      left corner of the panel, where the words "assistance type"
      appear in figure 1. The Help (F1), Limits (F5), Status
      (F7), Cmhlp (;c), and Xpad (F9) commands open the
      assistance panel. The program may open the assistance panel
      to display status information. Help and Limits provide
      information about the current screen and data fields;
      Status provides information about the current process;
      Cmhlp provides information about the available commands;
      and Xpad provides a "note pad" for making notes in the file
      XPAD.DAT. Use Quiet (F8) to close the assistance panel.

      Assistance panels display four lines at a time. In cases
      where the assistance information is greater than four
      lines, the cursor moves into the assistance panel. Use the
      up and down arrow keys to scroll through the information.
      If available, the Page Down and Page Up keys may be used to
      page through the information. Use the command mode toggle
      (;) to put the cursor back in the data panel.

      Instruction Panel

      The instruction panel provides information on how to
      interact with the current screen, such as how to enter data
      or how to advance to another screen. This panel appears at
      the bottom of the screen just above the screen commands
      (fig. 1). The instruction panel is present whenever the
      program requires input from the user. Up to four lines of
      text are displayed in an instruction panel. If an invalid
      keystroke is entered, the information in the instruction
      panel is replaced with an error message. In this case, the
      panel name (upper left hand corner) changes from the usual
      "INSTRUCT" to "ERROR." Once a valid keystroke is entered,
      the Instruct panel is redisplayed.


SPECIAL FILES
     Three files are associated with the interaction between the
     user and the program. System defaults that control how the
     program operates can be overridden by setting parameters in
     the optional TERM.DAT file. A session record is written to
     the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file each time the program is run; all
     or portions of this file can be used as input to the program
     at a later time. Error and warning messages, as well as some
     additional information, may be written to the file
     ERROR.FIL.

     System Defaults--TERM.DAT

     Certain aspects of the appearance and operation of the

     program are controlled by parameters within the program.
     These parameters specify things such as the computer system
     type, graphic output type, terminal type, program response
     to the Enter key, and colors. Each parameter is set based on
     the preferences of users who tested the program.  The preset
     values can be overridden by creating a TERM.DAT file in the
     directory where the program is initiated (the current
     working directory). The available parameters and the format
     of the TERM.DAT file are described in Appendix B. If a
     TERM.DAT file does not exist in the current directory, the
     message "optional TERM.DAT file not opened, defaults will be
     used" is displayed briefly when the program starts. If the
     TERM.DAT file is present, the message "reading users system
     parameters from TERM.DAT" is displayed.

     Session Record--PROGRAM_NAME.LOG

     The keystrokes entered during a program session are recorded
     in the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file.  Each time the program is run,
     an PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file is created; if one already exists
     in the current directory, it is overwritten. All or part of
     this file can be used as input to the program as a means of
     repeating the same or similar tasks. To do this, first save
     the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file under a different name. Modify the
     file to contain only the sequence of commands that need to
     be repeated. Then, at any point in a subsequent program
     session, press "@"; a small file name panel appears; type
     the name of the log file and press the Enter key. Appendix B
     describes the use and format of the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file.

     Error and Warning Messages--ERROR.FIL

     Any error or warning messages produced during a program
     session are written to the ERROR.FIL file. Each time the
     program is run, an ERROR.FIL file is created; if one already
     exists in the current directory, it is overwritten.
     Diagnostic and summary reports also may be written to this
     file. Examine ERROR.FIL if an unexpected program response is
     encountered.

     Many of the TERM.DAT parameters control graphical output and
     give the user the opportunity to change graphics devices,
     text fonts, symbol sizes, and background color. The values
     assigned to the graphics parameters depend on the software
     library used for graphics generation. On UNIX-based
     computers, the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) is used. The
     user should note that the graphics parameter values used for
     GKS as supplied by different vendors will not be the same;
     the documentation for the user's implementation of GKS
     should be consulted. On DOS-based computers, the INTERACTER
     graphics library from Interactive Software Services is used
     for graphics generation. See the README file distributed
     with the program for the most current information on
     producing graphical output using INTERACTER.

     Table 2.2 lists TERM.DAT parameters with their allowable
     values and their default values when using the program on a
     DOS-based computer, on a Data General computer under DG/UX,
     and on other UNIX-based computers. Table 2.3 lists TERM.DAT
     parameters specific to screen color assignment on DOS-based
     computers. The final table, 2.4, shows an example TERM.DAT
     file that modifies the background color of the graphics
     screen display from the default of black to a shade of
     purple.

     Special files

     Each time the program is run, two files are produced that
     aid in troubleshooting and in future program
     execution--ERROR.FIL and PROGRAM_NAME.LOG.

     The ERROR.FIL file contains any error messages produced
     while running the program.  Diagnostic and progress messages
     may be written to this file to aid in debugging.  This file
     should be consulted if an unexpected program response is
     encountered.

     The PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file contains a log of all keystrokes
     made while running the program.  This record of keystrokes
     is helpful when the program is repeatedly used to perform
     the same functions.  The file can be used as input to the
     program; the keystrokes are read from the file as if they
     were typed in.  To use the file in this way, first change
     its name to something other than PROGRAM_NAME.LOG to prevent
     the file from being overwritten the next time the program is
     started.  On any screen within the program, type "@" to be
     prompted for the log file name.  The contents of the file
     will be read and executed as appropriate.

     The first line in the log file should be an appropriate
     response to the screen where the name of the log file is
     provided. Occasionally, the log file contents will get out
     of sync with the input expected by the program.  When this
     happens, the program should be terminated and the log file
     should be edited to correctly order the responses.

     Log files are most easily created by using the program for
     the processes to be repeated and then modifying the log file
     for future program execution.  Alphabetic keys pressed will
     be recorded in the log file in the manner in which they were
     typed.  Nonprinting keys that are pressed, such as the
     function keys, the semicolon, the arrow keys, or the Page Up
     and Page Down keys, will be represented in the log file by a
     unique code number preceded by a pound sign ("#").  These
     code numbers are listed in the table below.  When planning
     to use a log file, you will discover it is easier to

METHOD
     The user interface was developed under the guidance of Dr.
     Albert Badre of the Georgia Institute of Technology who
     provided expertise on human-computer interaction.  The
     established theory and practice of user interfaces were
     used.

HISTORY
     Significant enhancements to the published version referenced
     below have been made by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
     and Environmental Protection Agency.  The USGS maintains the
     latest version.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
     The sole input requirement for a user of the interface is a
     keyboard with or without function keys and arrow keys.  A
     mouse is not used with the interface.  The input
     requirements for a programmer adding the interface to an
     existing application are an ASCII file of screen directives

     that describe the contents, layout, and help information for
     each screen, and the corresponding Fortran subroutine calls
     for display of the screens.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     UNIX-based computers (supported:  Data General AViiON and
     Sun SPARCstation).

     DOS-based computers having a math coprocessor and 4 mb of
     memory (supported: IBM-compatible computers with a 386 or
     greater processor).

     HASS-CUI is written in Fortran and C.  Generally, HASS-CUI
     applications are easily installed on other platforms.

APPLICATIONS
     HASS-CUI is the user interface for a number of USGS
     supported programs, including:

     ANNIE - Program to list, table, plot data in a WDM file
     GLSNET - Regional hydrologic regression and network
              analysis using generalized least squares
     HSPEXP - Expert system for calibration of HSPF
     IOWDM - Program to store time-series data in a WDM file
     PEAKFQ - Flood-frequency analysis based on Bulletin 17B
     SWSTAT - Surface-Water Statistics

     HASS-CUI is also used in a number of programs supported by
     the Environmental Protection Agency.

WARNINGS
     On UNIX-based computers, a monospaced font with a vt100
     line-drawing set must be used in order for all panel borders
     to be displayed properly.  For X Window System users, most
     of the X Window miscellaneous fixed fonts will work well, in
     particular 8x13bold, 9x15bold, and 10x20.

     Users of DOS-based computers must load ANSI.SYS in their
     CONFIG.SYS file for panel borders and text to be displayed
     properly.
