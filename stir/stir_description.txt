The Screening Tool for Inhalation Risk (STIR), estimates inhalation-type exposure based on 
pesticide-specific information. Also, STIR estimates spray droplet exposure using the application method (e.g., ground versus 
aerial spray) and rate, and then compares these exposure estimates to avian and mammalian toxicity data.
