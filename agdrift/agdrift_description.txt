<p>The primary function of AgDRIFT is to calculate the downward drift and deposition of pesticides and the magnitude of buffer zones needed to protect sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The Tier I model methodology uses different application type and drop size distributions to yield a conservative exposure estimate. Application type options in AgDRIFT include aerial, ground, and orchard/airblast. The aerial application model of spray drift is based on both mechanistic models and field data. The model outputs for ground and orchard/airblast models are based solely on field data. </p>
