<p>This page is based on Section 6 of PRZM manual, which briefly describes the theoretical background for the mathematical simulation model (PRZM) that has been developed and tested to evaluate pesticide leaching from the crop root zone under field crop conditions.</p>

<p>PRZM-3 model was derived from the conceptual, compartmentalized representation of the soil profile as shown in Figure 1. It is possible to write chemical mass balance equations for both the surface and subsurface zones.Addition of the vapor phase and ponded water compartments in PRZM-3 require the consideration of additional terms compared to previous PRZM releases. The surface zone mass balance expressions for each of the dissolved, adsorbed, and vapor phases are:</p>

<li>Water Movement</li>
<p>In the general case, Darcy's law can be combined with the continuity equation to yield the Richards equation (Richards 1931):</p>

<li>Chemical Application and Foliar Washoff</li>
<p>PRZM-3 contains 10 application options:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAM=1 Recommended for direct surface applications. Residues are distributed to 4 cm, linearly decreasing with depth.</li>
<li>CAM=2 Application to foliage based on a crop canopy that varies linearly during the growing season. This is the same as the previous FAM=2 in PRZM-2.</li>
<li>CAM=3 Pesticide foliar application using nonlinear exponential filtration. This is the same as the previous FAM=3 in PRZM-2.</li>
<li>CAM=4 Recommended for rototill incorporation. Uniform incorporation into the soil to a depth specified by the user.</li>
<li>CAM=5 Pesticide incorporation into an opened furrow that is then covered. Residues are distributed through the soil linearly, increasing to a user-defined depth.</li>
<li>CAM=6 Similar to CAM=1 except that residues are linearly decreasing to a user-defined depth.</li>
<li>CAM=7 Recommended for T-Band granular application. User defines the fraction of chemical to be applied in the top 2 cm, the remainder of the chemical is applied uniformly between 2 cm and a user-defined incorporation depth.</li>
<li>CAM=8 Recommended for shank injection. Residues are incorporated into a single compartment at a depth specified by the user.</li>
<li>CAM=9 Recommended for application to a linearly growing crop canopy. Chemical reaching the soil surface is incorporated to the depth given by DEPI (modified CAM 2).</li>
<li>CAM=10 Recommended for nonlinearly growing canopy using exponential filtration. Chemical reaching the soil surface is incorporated to the depth given by DEPI (modified CAM 3). DEPI must be set greater than 0.0 for CAM=4-10. If DEPI = 0, or DEPI < the depth of the first (top) surface soil layer, the chemical reaching the soil surface is distributed into the first (top) surface soil layer.</li>
</ul>

<li>Chemical dissolved in Runoff</li>
<p>Model restricts the amount of dissolved phase chemical that is allowed to mix with runoff water as a function of soil depth according to:</p>

<li>Soil Erosion</li>
<p>Removal of sorbed pesticides on eroded sediments requires estimates for soil erosion. PRZM release 3 provides three methods to estimate soil erosion: the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) as developed by Williams (1975), contained in earlier versions of PRZM, plus two recent modifications, MUST and MUSS (Williams 1995:933 in (Singh 1995)):</p>

<li>MUST:</li>

<li>MUSS:</li>

<img src = "/images/latex/przm/przm_image11.png">
</ul>

<li>Volatilization</li>
<p>The following key processes have been identified as being important in deriving the volatilization algorithms to simulate vapor-phase pesticide transport within the soil/plant compartments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vapor-phase movement of the pesticide in the soil profile</li>
<li>Boundary layer transfer at the soil-air interface</li>
<li>Vertical diffusion of pesticide vapor within the plant canopy</li>
<li>Pesticide mass transfer between the plant (leaves) and the surrounding atmosphere</li>
<li>Soil temperature effects on pesticide volatilization</li>
</ul>
<p>The discussion of the volatilization algorithms is presented in four parts: influence of vapor phase pesticide in soil and volatilization flux, volatilization flux through the plant canopy, volatilization flux from plant surfaces, and soil temperature modeling and effects. Figure 2 is a schematic of the pesticide vapor and volatilization processes considered in the PRZM-3 soil and plant compartments. Please refer to the manual for the detail equations.</p><br>

<li>Irrigation</li>
<p>PRZM-3 irrigation algorithms determine depths of irrigation water to be applied at the soil surface. These depths are computed based on the available soil water deficit, and are added as infiltration to the first (uppermost) PRZM soil compartment. Above- and below-canopy sprinklers, flooding, and furrow irrigation can be simulated. Methods for computing water application depths/amounts for each type of irrigation are described below (for detailed information please refer to manual).</p>
<p>Irrigation is triggered in PRZM-3 when the soil moisture volume in the active root zone (whose depth increases during crop development) falls to a user-defined fraction (with permissible range of 0.0 to 0.9) of the available water capacity (èfc -èwp). The soil moisture deficit, D, is then given by:</p>

<img src = "/images/latex/przm/przm_image14.png">
<li>Furrow Irrigation</li>
<img src = "/images/latex/przm/przm_image15.png">
</ul>


<li>Nitrogen Processes</li>
<p>Nitrogen species reactions can be divided between those that are chemical in nature and those that are a combination of chemical and biological reactions. The adsorption and desorption of ammonium is a chemical process. The user has the option of simulating ammonium adsorption and desorption by first order kinetics with subroutine FIRORD or by the Freundlich isotherm method with subroutine SV (discussed in the following). The other nitrogen species reactions are a combination of biological and chemical transformations. They all can be simulated with first order kinetics, but plant uptake can optionally use another algorithm. </p>
