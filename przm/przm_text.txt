<p>The Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM) is a one-dimensional, dynamic, compartmental model that can be used to simulate chemical movement in unsaturated soil systems within and immediately below the plant root zone. It has two major components – hydrology (and hydraulics) and chemical transport.</p> 

<p>The hydrologic component calculating runoff and erosion is based on the Soil Conservation Service curve number technique and the Universal Soil Loss Equation. Evapotranspiration is estimated either directly from pan evaporation data, or based on an empirical formula. Evapotranspiration is divided among evaporation from crop interception, evaporation from soil, and transpiration by the crop. Water movement is simulated by the use of generalized soil parameters, including field capacity, wilting point, and saturation water content.</p>

<p>The chemical transport component can simulate pesticides and organic and inorganic nitrogen species. For pesticides, the transport component can simulate pesticide application on the soil or on the plant foliage. Biodegradation can be modeled in the root zone. Dissolved, adsorbed, and vapor-phase concentrations in the soil are estimated by simultaneously considering the processes of pesticide uptake by plants, surface runoff and erosion, decay/transformation, volatilization, foliar washoff, advection, dispersion, and retardation/sorption. For nitrogen, simulation of surface applications, atmospheric deposition, and septic effluent discharge can all be simulated. The nitrogen species of nitrate, ammonia, and four forms of organic nitrogen (i.e. particulate organic nitrogen (labile and refractory) and dissolved organic nitrogen (labile and refractory)) are represented. The soil nitrogen processes considered include plant uptake of nitrate and ammonium, return of plant nitrogen as organic nitrogen, denitrification or reduction of nitrate-nitrite, immobilization of nitrate-nitrite and ammonium, mineralization of organic nitrogen, fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, volatilization of ammonium, and the adsorption/desorption of ammonium and the organic forms.</p>

<p>Predictions are made on a daily basis. Output can be summarized for a daily, monthly, or annual period. Daily time series values of various fluxes or storages can be written to sequential files during program execution for subsequent analysis.</p>
