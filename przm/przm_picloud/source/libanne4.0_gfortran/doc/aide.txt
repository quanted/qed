NAME
     aide - ANNIE Interaction Development Environment

ABSTRACT
     AIDE provides a consistent methodology for building
     character-based user interfaces for environmental software.
     Potential applications range from generating input files
     from user-supplied data for already existing scientific or
     environmental models to allowing user access to data bases
     for the purpose of searching, analyzing, or displaying data
     values.  AIDE provides applications programmers with the
     tools needed to build and store a convenient user interface
     whenever and wherever there is a need to perform one or more
     of the following operations:

         o  display text
         o  prompt the user to select a menu option
         o  prompt the user to input or edit data fields
         o  open a file to store or retrieve text and other
     information

     The advantages gained by using AIDE for interface
     development center on four concepts:  modularity,
     consistency, portability, and ease of application.  The
     system utilizes a library of routines to perform the basic
     communications functions between the user and the program.
     Repeated use of these subroutines allows the programmer to
     focus attention on designing an effective sequence of
     interactions while minimizing the effort needed to program
     the more mechanical aspects of the interface.  At the same
     time, the repeated use of modular routines decreases the
     likelihood of introducing programming errors.

     The AIDE library is included in the LIBANNE distribution.
     It requires the util and adwdm libraries from the LIBANNE
     distribution.

METHOD
     The user interface was developed under the guidance of Dr.
     Albert Badre of the Georgia Institute of Technology who
     provided expertise on human-computer interaction.  The
     established theory and practice of user interfaces were
     used.

HISTORY
     AIDE is a redesign of the interfaces from the original ANNIE
     program and the Environmental Model Input File Editor
     (EMIFE).  The AIDE user interface was developed under the
     guidance of Dr.  Albert Badre of the Georgia Institute of
     Technology who provided expertise on human-computer
     interaction.  The established theory and practice of user
     interfaces were used.  The original AIDE implementation was

     funded by EPA (1989).  Additional features were added by the
     USGS (1992).

     Version 4.0 2002/02/25 - The name of the lib library
        distribution changed to libanne.  See libanne
        documentation for details.

     Version 3.2 1998/06/29 - Updates

     Version 3.2 1998/03-06 - Updates

     Version 3.1 1996/12/11 - Updates

     Version 3.0 1996/03/01 - Include file names changed to lower
        case.  Increased maximum number of fields on a screen
        from 60 to 180.  File type data field added.

     Version 2.1 1994/08/11 - Updates

     Version 2.0 1994/05/27 - General release

     Version 1.0 1992 - General release, ported to UNIX platform.

     NOTE:  Version numbers and dates are for the entire set of
           libraries.  A new version does not necessarily
           indicate that the AIDE library has been changed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     AIDE is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension:
     use of include files. The AIDE library requires the ADWDM
     and UTIL libraries.

DOCUMENTATION
     A subroutine reference guide is provided in the
     distribution.
