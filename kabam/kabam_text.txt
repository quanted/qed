
<p>KABAM links hydrophobic organic pesticide bioaccumulation in aquatic components of a food web to terrestrial exposure in birds and mammals.  Given the dual ecosystem emphasis, KABAM is divided into two portions: 1) an aquatic bioaccumulation model and 2) a terrestrial risk component.  The bioaccumulation model is based off of a widely accepted model by Arnot and Gobas (2004) developed to evaluate PCB and select pesticide transfer through Great Lakes ecosystems.  Dietary and respiratory exposures are estimated using a pesticide’s octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW).  The terrestrial risk component follows EPA’s TREX model.  KABAM spans all trophic levels from aquatic primary producers and consumers to aquatic and terrestrial predators (Figure 1).</p>

<p>To use KABAM effectively, a pesticide must adhere to all 3 of the following characteristics:</p>

<li>	Be chemically non-ionic and organic</li>
<li>	Log KOW;  range = 4 – 8</li>
<li>	Can reach aquatic habitats</li>
