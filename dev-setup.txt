#clone from git from parent of where you want to have source

git clone https://github.com/quanted/qed.git
git checkout current_dev_branch

#open project in pycharm

#select python 2.7 in pycharm (cygwin python interpreters not supported)
#setup requires pip and sone_env? which are preinstalled with python 2.7+
#interpreter to see pycharm choices
#with Project:ubertool_eco selected; Files-> (Default) Settings ->Project Interpretor

#create virtualenv if you do not have one (optional with anaconda)
#also can be done from pycharm
#with Project:ubertool_eco selected; Files-> (Default) Settings ->Project Interpretor
#click gear and then create conda env or virtualenv
#name: env; dir ~/git/qed/ubetool_eco (where you cloned the repo)
# python version 2.7
#this directory is already git ignored in the repo

#if you need to run a configuration addition for conda env
#for a conda env you may have to use the command line and
#activate the virtual environment from the repo directory
./env/Scripts/activate
#and then
pip install whatever_package_conda_didnt_install

#you may already have a django run configuration in the upper right
#run from pycharm by clicking the green arrow in the title bar nest
#to the ubertool_eco icon
#or you may have to configure by selecting Edit Configurations in the title bar
#and associating python with manage.py

#run from the command line
python manage.py

#master is now a protected branch, you must commit to a dev/sprint/feature branch
#then make a pull request to someone else for review
