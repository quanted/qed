<p>The Tier I Rice Model (Version 1.0) is designed to estimate surface water exposure from the use of pesticide in rice paddies. It is a screening level model that is based on the Interim Rice Model, which has been used by the Environmental Fate and Effects Division for multiple years. The model calculates a single, screening-level concentration that represents both short and long term surface water exposures. The screening-level concentraion can be used for both aquatic ecological risk assessments and drinking water exposure assessments for human health risk assessment. </p>
