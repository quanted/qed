 Version    Date    Description
 -------  --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
   4.0    02/02/25  Changes and corrections in graphics related to font
                    and color. Added new fonts for the PC version (gksint.f
                    and parmpc.seq).  Corrected how code determined the
                    font that would be used for the screen and plotter
                    (agplot.f).  Corrections in awstat for problems in
                    frequency computations when season attributes were
                    missing from data set, TSTYPE was missing or not
                    recognized, and negative parameter values were being
                    reported for low flows.  Frequency computations were
                    enhanced to compute the 3-year recurrance interval
                    and to optionally save new attributes L07050, L07100,
                    and L04003 to the WDM file.

          01/05/29  Corrected calculations for last available group for
                    attribute data and time series data.  User-specified
                    min and max for a probability axes will now be
                    forced to be symetrical about 0; addtional help
                    information added for min and max fields.  Miscellaneous
                    spelling corrections.

                    Code group wdmess was modified to correctly
                    recognize that there was still available space
                    to add an attribute value to a data set.  Code
                    group wdtms1 was modified so that the last data
                    group in a time series data set was recognized
                    and to retrieve the data from that group; earlier
                    version correctly stored data in the last group
                    but would not retrieve it using the wdtget
                    routine (data could be exported).

                    Code group agplot modified to force user-specified
                    limits for probablility axis to be symetrical about
                    0, with the maximum value equal to the maximum of
                    the absolute values of minimum and maximum and the
                    minimum the negative of the maximum.

          01/01/16  Added attributes DATCRE, DATMOD, P1.5, and P2.33.
                    All wdm data sets will now contain the date the data
                    set was created and the date it was last modified.
                    Resolved conflict introduced by GenScn program
                    between index numbers used for DATCRE and DATMOD and
                    for SEADBG and SEADND.  Fixed problems in frequency
                    code with maximum number of plot files that can be
                    produced and with images being drawn too big for the
                    page.  wdmrx enhanced to check for problems in wdm
                    files and, when possible, to resolve them.

                    In version 3.2, two new attributes were introduced.
                    they are used by the SWSTAT program.  SEADBG (443)
                    is the starting day of a season and SEADND (444)
                    is the ending day of a season.  They are used in
                    combination with SEASBG AND SEASND.  The index
                    numbers used for these attributes conflicted with
                    attributes DATCRE and DATMOD which were added for
                    GenScn to document the dates a data set was created
                    and last modified, respectively.  The index numbers
                    for SEADBG and SEADND are now 446 and 447.  If you
                    have wdm files that were created using version 3.2
                    of swstat, you will need to run the wdmrx program
                    to correct these attributes before you use any other
                    applications to analyze the data sets.  The wdmrx
                    program is a part of the libanne distribution.   For
                    convenience, wdmrx is also included in the swstat
                    and annie distributions, see swstat or annie at
                    http://water.usgs.gov/software/.

          99/07/30  The name of the lib library distribution changed to
                    libanne.  The libraries specific to hspf (hspf, newaqt,
                    and hspnodss) that were a part of lib are now found in
                    the libhsp distribution.  A problem with small negative
                    numbers in export files has been resolved.  A few minor
                    changes were made in the code with respect to Y2K.  Some
                    new routines added to library and some code rearranged.
                    Miscellaneous minor corrections and cleanups.

                    Corrected problem introduced with June 29, 1998 revision
                    in wdexpt.f, which caused some small negative numbers to
                    be exported as "*****".

                    In adwdm/utwdt1.f, prec was incorrectly checked for a
                    maximum of 200,000 as the maximum number of data sets.
                    Since 200,000 is actually a hex constant, the code was
                    updated to a value of 2,097,152. (jlk)

                    There were a number of changes made in awstat/a193.f to
                    clarify the code.  Subroutine pra193 was reorganized
                    into subroutines pra193, lgpfit, lgpst1, lgpst2, and
                    lgpplt.  

                    In awstat/stutil.f, the routines dsinf1, dsinf2, and
                    gtinfo were added.

                    There were a couple of changes in graph.  In grgks.f,
                    removed call to gqchb; this was informational and is
                    not found in gligks.  In grsyux.f, commented out call
                    to gesc and added dummy gprec routine for gligks.

                    In util/utdate.f, added routines gtmonc, dhleap, dhbegn,
                    dhincr, and dbndry.  In util/utscdg.f, changed key,
                    escape, arrow, and keypad from integer*2 to integer.

                    In waide/qtfils.f added reopen and stflop.  In
                    waide/tstabl, changed declaration of bad from integer
                    to real in tbspec.  Added new code group atsave.f.

                    In wdm/wdexpt.f, changed export format from 1pg12.6 to
                    g12.6.  In wdm/wdtms3.f, changed zipr to zipi to
                    initialize qval in wdtgtq.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 NOTE:  In July, 1999, the name of the library distribution changed from 
        lib to libanne.  The hspf, newaqt, and hspnodss libraries used by
        the hspf model are now found in the libhsp distribution.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.2    98/06/29  Corrected problem introduced with April 6, 1998 revision
                    in wdexpt.f, which increased the precision of data values
                    exported from wdm time-series data sets.  wdimpt.f has
                    been modified to correctly read the exported data values.
                    In some cases the leftmost significant digit of data
                    values was not read (for example, 0.01 may have been
                    read as 0.0).

   3.2    98/03/06  Modified util/utdate.f to correct problem with determining
                    the earliest or latest date from an array of dates.
                    Modified wdm/wdimpt.f to clarify a warning message.
                    Modified hspf/posvm.inc, which had a dimension that limited
                    the number of quality constituents that could be modeled
                    Modified adwdm/attr251.seq and attr401.seq for changes
                    related to swstat program.  Modified wdm/wdexpt.f to
                    change the precision of data values exported from wdm
                    time-series data sets.  Modified awstat/tscmpr.f to
                    correctly calculate total mean absolute error and root
                    mean square error (both percents.)

                    In utdate.f, the subroutine dlimit was incorrectly finding
                    the earliest (or latest) date in an array of dates.  The
                    correct value was returned only if it happened to be the
                    first or last date in the array.  This is now corrected to
                    find the date anywhere in the array.  This change will 
                    affect any program that used this subroutine, in particular
                    annie and swstat.

                    In wdimpt.f, subroutine prwmti, any non-zero return code
                    would cause an error message to be printed.  In many
                    cases, no real problem existed, so the error was changed
                    to a warning.  This message was noticed in annie and wdimex
                    when importing data sets into a wdm file.

                    In posvm.inc, the parameter posvsz was set to 2500.  It
                    has been increased to 6000.  When quality was being
                    simulated, 2500 was not large enough to hold all the
                    parameters for each rchres needed in the osvm array
                    (cosv.inc).  This problem could be seen in the programs
                    hspf, hspexp, and genscn.

                    Added text to definition of attributes SEASBG and SEASND
                    in attr251.seq.  Added attributes SEADBG and SEADND to
                    attr401.seq.  SEASBG and SEASND define the start and end
                    months of a year or season.  SEADBG and SEADND have been
                    added to further defind the season or year to specific
                    beginning and ending days.

                    When data was being exported from time-series data sets,
                    the precision being used was 4 significant digits.
                    This had been adequate for the applications that used
                    the data in the past.  Recently, some users have found
                    that they need greater precision.  The software will
                    now generate data to 6 significant digits.  The output
                    format was modified in wdm/wdexpt.f

                    When two time series were being compared, the total
                    mean absolute error (percent) and root mean square
                    error (percent) were being incorrectly computed
                    (awstat.tscmpr.f).  It can be observed that the
                    values originally computed were not consistent with
                    the values computed for the individual classes.
             

   3.1    96/12/11  Modified util/utgnrl.f and wdm/wdatru.f.

                    The function CNVTDG in util/utgnrl.f is used to
                    convert degree-minute-second latitudes and longitudes
                    to decimal degrees.  This function was calculating
                    values that were off by a factor of 10.  The function
                    has been re-written to correctly convert the values.
                    This function was known to be used by the peakfq, glsnet,
                    and metcmp programs.  However, in most cases, latitude
                    and longitude are provided in decimal degrees, and
                    the function was not called.  See the program-specific
                    documentation for glsnet and peakfq for information on
                    any problems that may need to be addressed.

                    The new subroutine WDBSGL was added to wdm/wdatru.f.
                    This subroutine can be called to retrieve the latitude
                    and longitude from a wdm data set.  The subroutine will
                    first attempt to retrieve decimal degrees from attributes
                    LATDEG (54) and LNGDEG (55).  If there is a problem
                    with either LATDEG or LNGDEG, the subroutine will look for
                    attributes LATDMS (8) and LNGDMS (9) and convert them to
                    decimal degrees.  If there is a problem with either LATDMS
                    or LNGDMS, the subroutine will look for attributes LATCTR
                    (96) and LNGCTR (97).  If none of these attributes are
                    present, the subroutine will return 0.0 for LAT and LNG
                    and the RETCOD from the attribute retrieval that failed.

   3.0.1  96/07/12  Change made to subroutine GPM in gksint.f in graph.f.
                    GPM used to call a routine called GMARKR, which is
                    no longer included in newer copies of interactor.
                    So instead of keeping two different versions of
                    gksint.f for the two versions of interactor, calls
                    to GMARKR have been changed to GMARK1, which is
                    a part of code group grmark.  Note that this change
                    is applicable only to versions of the program that
                    use the interactor library for graphics.

   3.0    04/15/96  Modified subroutine GSUTPW in grgks.f.  There was
                    a problem with designating an output device in many
                    applications that use graph.  If the user first drew
                    the plot on the screen and then modified the output
                    device to cgm, everything worked fine.  However, if
                    the user initially selected cgm for the ouput device,
                    there was a floating point exception and the program
                    crashed.  The corrections were made specific to the
                    Prior gks library on the Data General.  This problem
                    may not exist for cgm files using other gks libraries.

   3.0    03/01/96  Modified subroutine ucirea to resolve problems opening
                    files identified in a uci file.  Code now checks to
                    see if a file is already open, file is closed if
                    it is open and then re-opened.  Problems had been
                    encountered with Fortran 90 compilers that objected
                    to opening an already open file.  The problem was
                    only apparent in program hspexp.

   3.0    01/17/96  Corrected minimum value for attribute JANMIN in
                    attr051.seq.  Also made a couple of minor editing
                    corrections.

                    The minimum value had been defined as 0.0, this
                    was changed to no minimum value (-999).

                    NOTE:  this correction will affect message files
                           in many programs.

   3.0    08/10/95  Modified subroutine wdtput, constant ALLFLG was
                    changed from 1 to 0.  This affects how new data
                    overwrites existing data.

                    subrroutine grsygn.f was deleted,  Uses grsyux.f
                    instead.

   3.0    06/13/95  made all include file names lower case, resolved any
                    shared include

   3.0    06/05/95  sequential files used by src/ann code groups were
                    moved from annie to msg/ann

   3.0    05/18/95  Revised how text is written to plot.

   3.0    03/30/95  Correction made in hspf simulation of evapotranspiration.

                    There was a problem in subroutine ETLZON with the check
                    to see if there was enough storage in the lower zone
                    to meet the potential.  If not, LZET had been set to
                    the current lower zone storage (LZS), completely emptying
                    the storage, causing an underflow to occur in subroutine
                    SURFAC.  The code was modified to set LZET to LZS - 0.02,
                    leaving a small amount in storage.

                    Code group src/hspf/hperwat.f was modified.

   3.0    11/11/94  Miscellaneous changes.

                    Renamed system-dependent time routines to resolve conflict
                    with COE library routine juldat.  The following system
                    dependent routines are found in dttm[dc dg pc pr sg sn].f
                    in the util directory;

                              DATNOW --> SYDATM
                              JULDAT --> SYDATE
                              GETIME --> SYTIME

                    Code group aide/qtprin.f split into aide-dependent code
                    group aide/prtaid.f and non-aide-dependent adwdm/prtfil.f.

                    Routines FLSETC, QSTBUF, QSTBFB, QGTBUF, & QGTBFB added
                    to qtstgt.f.

   3.0    10/10/94  Miscellaneous changes.

                    Increased the maximum number of fields on a screen from
                    60 to 180.

                    Added new callback routines.
