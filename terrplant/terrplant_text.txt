<p>TerrPLANT provides screening level estimates of exposure to terrestrial plants from single pesticide applications through runoff or drift.  Monocots and dicots found in dry or semi-aquatic habitats can be evaluated using this model.  Exposure estimates can be generated for both listed and non-listed species using TerrPLANT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both dry and semi-aquatic exposure estimates include conceptual models with a target area that is adjacent to a non-target area.  Dry area estimates are determined using pesticide amounts received in the non-target area through sheet runoff from a target area equal in size.  Semi-aquatic estimates are based on pesticide amounts in channel runoff from a target area that is 10 times larger than then non-target area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TerrPLANT model assumes that 1% of the mass of liquid pesticides applied per acre will runoff to the non-target area, 5% for aerial pesticides and 0% for granular applications.  Toxicity of pesticides to non-listed species is based on EC25 values for the most sensitive monocots and dicots tested.  For listed species, corresponding NOEC or EC50 values are used to determine toxicity.  RQ values are generated through comparisons with adverse effects levels measured in seedling emergence studies.</p>
